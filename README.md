Just a few of muy blueprints to have it version controlled. Feel free to use, copy, fork them.

# Automations

## Apply selected scene
Applies the scene that is selected in a dropdown. This dropdown must contain the exact entity id's of the scenes, including domain.

This is far from special, but it fitted my personal needs for now.

# Scripts

## Notification Adapter
After getting a new phone I have to update all my automations. To make sure this was the last time doing this I made a script that works as an adapter for notifications. If I get a new phone again I just have to update the single script. To make it reusable for my wife's phone I turned it into a blueprint.
