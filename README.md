# Scripts

## Notification Adapter
After getting a new phone I have to update all my automations. To make sure this was the last time doing this I made a script that works as an adapter for notifications. If I get a new phone again I just have to update the single script. To make it reusable for my wife's phone I turned it into a blueprint.
